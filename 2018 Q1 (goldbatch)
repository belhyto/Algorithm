Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept a number.
Step 3: Check if the number is even.
Step 4: If step 4 is true then stop.
Step 5: In a while loop initialise 2 numbers a and b where a is smaller than n and b = n-a
Step 6: Using an if loop check if a and b are prime and a <= b.
Step 7: Increase the value of a by 2.
Step 8: Reapeat step 5 till all pairs are printed.
Step 9: Stop.
